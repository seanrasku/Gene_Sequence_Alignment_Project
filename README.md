# Gene_Sequence_Alignment_Project

This project applies the concept of edit distance to gene sequencing to find similarities between genetic sequences. Edit distance measures the likelihood that two sequences (that can take multiple forms, including spoken words, written words, files, genes, etc) are related. By using the supplied data, my Python code measures the edit distance of 2 gene sequences, and calculates their optimal alignment.
